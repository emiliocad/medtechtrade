Linde Medical Sensors MicroGas 7650 is a blood gas monitor equipped with an integrated calibrator.\
The device provides reliable, continuous measurement of transcutaneous oxygen and carbon\
dioxide tensions by using a combined PO2/PCO2 sensor (type COMBI•M). The sensor is calibrated\
fully automatically when it is placed into the built-in calibration chamber. When not in use, the sensor\
is stored within the calibration chamber and the system is ready to use at any time. The monitor\
detects and gives warning when the oxygen and/or the carbon dioxide tensions exceeds the alarm\
limits, the values of which are adjustable by the operator.","2010-11-26",\N,"0","164","0","Linde Medical Sensors","Blood Gas Monitor TCp02 / CO2","Micro GAS 7650","","CH","","196","19941212","5.6","30","26.6","13.5","","","","","1196","OK, working","1","21307","1","196.MicroGas 7650 Service manual Feb 05.pdf","","","","","1"
